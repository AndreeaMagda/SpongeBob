You probably know what this is from. This is a replica of the model used in Awe's first few SpongeBob game FMVs.

This particular one is modeled off of how he appears in Operation Krabby Patty.


FOR OUTLINES:

SpongeBob LANPR.blend has outlines set up already, but you will need a special version of Blender
to view these. This is because Freestyle lines are not adequate enough, and this special version's feature will
soon be added into official Blender, somewhere around 2.9.
